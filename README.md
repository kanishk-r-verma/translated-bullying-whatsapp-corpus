# Leveraging machine translation for cross-lingual fine-grained cyberbullying classification amongst pre-adolescents
 
This repo hosts the translated dataset and python notebooks to split and merge translated datasets for the paper "_Leveraging machine translation for cross-lingual fine-grained cyberbullying classification amongst pre-adolescents_" published in _Journal of Natural Language Engineering_ 2022.

In the study, we have translated the original Italian WhatsApp dataset by [Sprugnoli et al 2018](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-5107/) to study cyberbullying among Italian students aged 12-13.

# Details

/WhatsApp-Dataset : git clone https://github.com/dhfbk/WhatsApp-Dataset.git

/raw : Generated by runninng - convert_raw_to_csvs.ipynb - Files are converted from xml to json to pandas DataFrame (csv); they were provided to translators

/translated: is generated by runninng - convert_raw_to_csvs.ipynb - Files are converted from xml to json to pandas DataFrame; they were shared by translators

/merged : First run get_emoji_transcriptions.ipynb to scrape and collect emoji data in /pre_process/emoj_info.csv
        : Then run merge_raw_translated.ipynb to merge human translated with raw

Then run to clean_merge_split.ipynb to create raw_italian_ordered.csv, shared for MT experiments

Then run block split data in clean_merge_split to create train.csv, test.csv, validation.csv, scenario_c.csv

PLEASE NOTE:
{train|test|validation|scenario}.csv contain File & SentenceNumber; For Labels see folders raw and merged for files with bullyData

data_whatsapp.json is shared by the authors [Sprugnoli et al 2018](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-5107/) to study cyberbullying among Italian students aged 12-13.  as a json file.
